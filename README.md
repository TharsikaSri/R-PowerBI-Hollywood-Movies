<div align="center"> <h2 align="center"> Greetings to the Hollywood Movies project. Inside this repositiory, you'll discover documentation and code designed for a comprehensive analysis of the Hollywood Movies dataset. The tools I have used for this project are R and PowerBI </h2> </div>

<div align="center"> <h3 align="center"> 🎯 Goals 🎯 </h3> </div>
The aim of the Hollywood Movies project is to clean the data using tools and techniques within R and then create a user friendly dashboard on both R and PowerBI to share and represent the results.

<div align="center"> <h3 align="center"> 🔢 Dataset 🔢 </h3> </div>
The dataset used is called "Dataset- HollywoodsMostProfitableStories.csv". It consists of 1 table with 8 columns. The table provides valuable information on film names, genre, audience score, lead studio, profitability, Rotten Tomatoes, Worldwide gross and year.
